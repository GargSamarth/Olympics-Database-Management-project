### Olympics-Database-Management-project
# In this project, we have designed a database management system to store information about Olympic Games. 
# The database will contain important information about the event organisation and will be accessible to International Olympic Committee.
# This database will contain the details of the Athletes, participating countries, fixtures, event participation, information about the various 
# games organised (group and individual), venues and services, results and leader board. 
# This database management system will help the International Olympic Committee to access various types of information and improve the quality of 
# conduction of these games in the future. 
# They can also keep track of the various services and equipment required during the games and assess how many more will be needed.
